// appscan.sh: Command to trigger the HCL AppScan. Adjust the parameters (e.g., server URL, username, password) according to your setup.
// scanResult.contains('<IssueSeverity>High</IssueSeverity>'): Parses the generated AppScan XML report to check for critical vulnerabilities (e.g., "High" severity). If found, it will abort the pipeline.
