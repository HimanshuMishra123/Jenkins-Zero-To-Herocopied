In Jenkins, both "Manage Credentials" and "Configure System" are used for configuration purposes, but they serve different roles and are used in different contexts:

### **Manage Credentials**

"Manage Credentials" is specifically designed for securely storing and managing sensitive data such as:

- **Passwords**
- **API tokens**
- **Secret keys**
- **SSH keys**

**Benefits of Using Manage Credentials:**

1. **Security**: Credentials are stored securely and can be encrypted.
2. **Access Control**: You can set specific permissions for accessing credentials, which helps in managing who can view or use sensitive information.
3. **Modularity**: Credentials can be easily reused across multiple jobs or pipelines without exposing the actual values in the job configuration or pipeline scripts.
4. **Convenience**: Credentials can be updated centrally without modifying the individual jobs that use them.

**Use Case**: Store sensitive information like SonarQube authentication tokens, Docker registry passwords, or Trivy API keys.

### **Configure System**

"Configure System" is typically used for setting global Jenkins configurations, including:

- **Global environment variables**
- **Tool configurations (e.g., JDK, Git, Maven)**
- **Plugin configurations**
- **Global properties and settings**

**Benefits of Using Configure System:**

1. **Global Scope**: Settings here apply to all jobs and pipelines, providing a single place to manage global configurations.
2. **Consistency**: Helps ensure consistency across all Jenkins jobs by providing a single source of truth for global settings.

**Use Case**: Define global settings like default JDK versions, Maven installations, or URL endpoints that are not sensitive.

### **Which to Use and Why**

- **Use Manage Credentials for Sensitive Information**:
  - **Security**: Storing sensitive information like passwords, API keys, and tokens in "Manage Credentials" ensures they are encrypted and access-controlled.
  - **Reusability**: Credentials stored here can be easily referenced across different jobs or pipelines without exposing them in job configurations or pipeline scripts.
  - **Best Practice**: It is a best practice to use credentials management for sensitive information to prevent accidental exposure or misuse.

- **Use Configure System for Non-sensitive Global Configurations**:
  - **Global Consistency**: Use "Configure System" for configurations that apply globally across Jenkins, such as tool installations, global environment variables (that are not sensitive), and plugin configurations.
  - **Ease of Management**: It simplifies the management of settings that are shared across all jobs and pipelines.

**Example**:

- **Storing SonarQube Token and URL**:
  - **Token**: Store the SonarQube authentication token in "Manage Credentials" for security.
  - **URL**: If the SonarQube URL is not sensitive, it could be stored in "Configure System" as a global environment variable. However, if the URL is sensitive (e.g., in private networks or contains information not meant to be publicly visible), it should also be stored in "Manage Credentials".

**Best Practice Recommendation**:

For best practices and security reasons, always use "Manage Credentials" for any information that could be considered sensitive or security-critical. Use "Configure System" for general configurations that do not pose security risks and are intended to be shared across the entire Jenkins instance.
